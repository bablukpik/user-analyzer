# Task
Build a mobile web application using React to analyze app usage data for a hypothetical menu planning calendar app. On any day, a user can plan multiple meals, and each meal may have multiple dishes. The program you build will analyze how engaged users are with the app.

Given a specific date range, your analyzer should filter users into three types

* Active: users who had at least 5 meals in the specified period

* Superactive: users who had more than 10 meals in the specified period

* Bored: Users who were “active” in the preceding period, but not “active” in the specified period.

# Tested Device
I have checked the application in Xiaomi Note 9 Pro and it appears to be working fine. I have not been able to test it on any iOS device.
